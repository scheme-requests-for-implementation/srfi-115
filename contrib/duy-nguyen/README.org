This is from ~(chibi regexp)~, renamed to ~(srfi 115)~ and made sure
only srfi symbols are exported. ~(chibi char-set boundary)~ becomes
~(srfi 115 boundary)~.

Some chibi-specific SRE syntaxes such as ~digit~, ~=>~, ~*->~, ~*=>~,
and ~*$~ are also removed.  PCRE tests are removed.
~regexp-match->sexp~ is replaced with ~regexp-match->list~ in tests
because the former is not part of ~(srfi 115)~.  Unicode tests
~cond-expand~ed (because Gerbil does not support it)

~115.sld~ now also supports SRFI 130, which is available in quite many
schemes (and more optimal in Gauche).

~(chibi test)~ is only needed for running the test suites.

Tested with Gauche, Chibi, Larceny, Sagittarius and Gerbil.
